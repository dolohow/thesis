The goal of this work was to show that implementing and understanding REST concepts are very easy. We presented key features and principles of it. Pros and cons so the reader can decide if it is a good choice for his needs.

Then the sample architecture was proposed in order to leverage communication between clients and servers of the main, central server. It can be further modified by adding new servers or providing additional layers depends on needs.

Framework was created in Go for everyone to use free of charge. Anyone can extend it by writing new custom middlewares or contribute to core of it. Most important code fragments were described. This also demonstrates how is easy is to create simple communication mechanism implemented in fairly new language with well designed standard library.

All and all there is always much to say about REST and its implementation, yet all the requirements expectations have been met.
