The goal of this work was to implement REST framework for faster development of applications which communicate with each other and that communication can be held by servers and clients as well. With this piece of software one can easily employ message exchanging in any sort of application that needs to be fast, secure and well defined and to expose some resources. Key features and principles of REST and framework were presented.

Example architecture was proposed in order to leverage communication between clients and servers of the main, central server. It can be further modified by adding new servers or providing additional layers depends on needs. The REST prove itself in this scenario as fast and reliable method of communication.

Framework was created in Go for everyone to use free of charge. Anyone can extend it by writing new custom middlewares or contribute to core of it. Most important code fragments were described. This also demonstrates how is easy is to create simple communication mechanism implemented in fairly new language with well designed standard library.

During the work, author of this project struggled a lot with unit testing, but finally he made it through. After the hassle, simple and beautiful framework emerged and all the requirements and expectations have been met.
