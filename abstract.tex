  Many people wants to easily create REST applications, but implementing all the requirements needed for such communication takes a lot of time. Why every time developers should be starting from scratch? Why not to create a tool that will help to quickly create REST applications in new modern language?

  The idea is to create a framework which will implement REST properties in Go programming language using mountable modules that could be further extended, modified or created. This language is new on the market and its missing some simple, yet powerful ways to quickly develop RESTful applications.

  The reason for utilizing REST is the fact that most of the applications needs to handle many users. Provide security of data being transfered and the fact that it is supported by every web browser, which is the way most people uses their computers nowadays.

  Following thesis should prove that choice of the REST architecture is reasonable and justified. Chapters presents implementation of core modules that are essential for any REST based application with theoretical background and related examples.
